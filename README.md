Autonomous Store READ ME

This project was for a Software Design Patterns course at Harvard University. The project was made completed over a semester in three intervals, there are three design documents that accompany them. The design documents can be found in a folder in the main repository. Here is a brief overview:

This project is a virtual Autonomous Store. Use of the store is simulated through a custom Command Line Interface that iniates components and includes events that would happen in the store. Example scripts to initialize and simulate the store are provided in the main repo. The store has three main components. 

Store Models:
The store models arethe java classes that represent the data and functions of physical components and data types within the store such as Baskets, Appliances, Customers, Events, Inventories and more. 

Controller:
The controller handles the actions that occur from events that happen with in the store. These actions utilize the components within the Store Models and affects the data objects described there. 

Ledger:
The ledger is a hashed blockchain cryptocurrency that handles all the transactions within the store while also monitoring and updating balances of the Store and Customers.
